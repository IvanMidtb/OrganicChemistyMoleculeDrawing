How to use the program:

When prompted to enter an organic compound you should enter the name of the compound you wish to draw
The name should have a parent chain that is an alkane. These are formed by taking the appropriate prefix and adding 'ane'
to the end. The following is a list of valid prefixes and the number of carbons that each corresponds to:
{'meth': 1, 'eth': 2, 'prop': 3, 'but': 4, 'pent': 5, 'hex': 6, 'hept': 7, 'oct': 8, 'non': 9, 'dec': 10,
'undec': 11, 'dodec': 12}
The parent chain forms the base of the compound and forms a zigzag line with a number of lines that is one less than the
corresponding number of carbons.

A suffix can be added to the parent chain that will add complexity, the suffix should replace the last 'e' in the parent
chain. Choose from the following: {'ol', 'one', 'al'}. This will add an alcohol, ketone or aldehyde group to the chain
respectively. If it is writen in the form: parent chain-#-suffix, where the number represents the carbon where the
functional group will be added (The number should be smaller than the number of carbons). eg. butan-2-ol

Prefixes can also be added. You can take a prefix from the earlier list and add 'yl' to form a carbon chain that will
come off the main chain, a number and '-' should be added before to indicate where it is placed. For example:
2-methylpropane. You can also use a prefix from the following list to add functional groups:
'hydroxy', 'fluoro', 'chloro', 'bromo', 'iodo', 'one', 'oxo'
Anything that comes off of the main chain is a substituent. If a substituent is present on more than one carbon this can
be indicated by listing all the numbers with a ',' in between. Different substituents are separated with dashes.
For example 2,3-methyl-3,4-chloropentanol
